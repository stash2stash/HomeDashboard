# HomeDashboard #

## Overview ##

* HomeDashboard is my realisation of a simple homepage which displays various useful information using widgets.
* The idea is to have this page always open on some dedicated monitor or other screen.
* Current version: __deep alpha__

## Dependencies ##

* SQLite database to run
* Java SE Development Kit to compile

## Install SQLite (Windows) ##

* Go to SQLite download page, and download precompiled binaries from Windows section. You will need to download sqlite-shell-win32-*.zip and sqlite-dll-win32-*.zip zipped files.
* Create a folder C:\sqlite (for example) and unzip above two zipped files in this folder which will give you sqlite3.def, sqlite3.dll and sqlite3.exe files.
* Add C:\sqlite in your PATH environment variable.
* I also recommend to download SqliteAdmin
